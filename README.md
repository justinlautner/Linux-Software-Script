# Linux-Initial-Packages

## My most important linux software, all in one place, for making a fresh install nice and simple. Also, this way I cannot possibly forget to install that one program that i love will all of my heart, but for some definitely non-insulting reason I cannot remember to download it on my own... :)

### If by some very odd circumstance you ended up here, and have the same love for forgetful software as I... Well, we've just won the lottery!

#### Heres how to claim your prize: 
To allow permission to run the script:
---------------
```
cd /path/to/target

chmod +x the_file_name
```
To then run the script:
------------------
```
cd /path/to/target

./software
```

##### P.S. This includes both snap and apt programs... If you hate snap, like * *SOME* * people... Leave. Now. How dare you come on my turf and complain! >:(
